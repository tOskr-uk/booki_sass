Questions



v1.1

Questions
---------
- I noticed the order of the filters changes from the breakpoint views. Is this a 
  requirement?

- Also, the 'pets allowed' filter has a lot of extra white space at the end.  Is 
  this expected in the actual page?

- Can i add additional media queries to better manage styles between the specified 
  in the scope? e.g. font sizes withnin the cards. To build as per the design 
  provided the font sizes in the cards (accomodation section as example) will wrap
  when the page shrinks to the min desktop breakpoint (992px) resulting in the card
  contents being pushed outside the card boundaries (card height is fixed). 

  If i tweek the font size so they stay on one line until the 768px breakpoint they
  are not to scale in desktop view and dont match the design in the scope.

- Activities section: Is there a better way to build this maintaining grid dims 
  for gaps and images? Currently using margins but the leftmost and rightmost grid 
  elements are slightly larger than the rest due to only having  margins applied 
  to one side. How would you approach this section?
 
- Funtional Spec states: All maps for accommodation and activities should be 
  entirely clickable (and not just the title). For the time being the links are
  empty. You can use a “href=”#”” attribute to simulate the presence of a link.

  What exactly are the 'maps'? i had presumed these were the nav maps / links but 
  the 4th bullet point states these should link to the sections of the page so would 
  therefore not use a href="#".

  - Do we have to use normalise.css or can we use resets?


ToDo
----
- put links on the footer lists.
- links on the cards.
